# ImOnThePHone! 📱

**ImOnThePHone!** is a lightweight Magisk module designed as a specialized alternative to large GApps packages. Instead of bloating your system with every Google service, this module focuses on one thing: getting the native Samsung Phone app back on your device.

## 🛠 Features
* **Minimalist**: Only installs the Samsung Phone app (`SamsungDialer`).
* **Systemless**: Uses Magisk to overlay files, keeping your system partition intact.
* **Clean**: No extra trackers or background services.

## ⚠️ Important Requirements
* **Magisk**: You must have Magisk installed to flash this module.
* **Samsung Framework**: This app is designed for Samsung-based ROMs. 
    * *Note: If you are running a pure AOSP or LineageOS custom ROM, the app may force close because it requires Samsung system files to function.*

2.  Open the **Magisk App** on your device.
